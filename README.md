# Algorithms & Visualizations

* Implementing algorithms from Princeton Algorithms 1 with Python
* Trying to go the extra mile to visualize algorithm operation and/or results whenever possible
* Trying to concurrently learn PyTest by writing tests for the implementations

## Union Find
* Implementation based on [Assignment 1 - Percolation](http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/percolation.html)
